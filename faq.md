# Modmail's Frequently Asked Questions
## Last Updated ~ July 10th, 2019

#### 1. What is Modmail?
##### Modmail is akin to Reddit's Modmail both in functionality and purpose. It serves as a shared inbox for server staff to communicate with their users, and vice versa, in a seamless way.

#### 2. Can I invite Modmail?
##### Due to the nature of how Modmail works, you can't invite the bot. You need to deploy your own by following the [tutorial on the wiki](https://github.com/kyb3r/modmail/wiki/Installation). Alternatively, you can make use of the hosting service for Patrons. For more details, visit [Kyber's patreon](https://patreon.com/kyber) or the [support server for Modmail](https://discord.gg/j5e9p8w).

#### 3. How does Modmail work?
##### Modmail utilizes the Discord API to interact with the platform. When someone sends a DM to the bot, it will create a new thread. Members of the moderation team can reply by using the ``?reply`` command, whereupon the bot will redirect that message to the recipient. Once a conversation is over,  you can use the ``?close`` command. After a thread is closed you will be given a highly complex log on your own logviewer. You can also make snippets and command aliases for ease of use.

#### 4. Can my Modmail be hacked?
##### Your modmail is safe as long as you don't share your bot's token. If you share your token a "hacker" can take control over your bot.

#### 5. Can I request new features?
##### Modmail is an open-source project, which means you can easily add or request new features. You can make a PR or issue on the [Modmail](https://github.com/kyb3r/modmail/issues) repository.

#### 6. How do I become Support Staff

#### 7. Can I add commands to the bot?

#### 8. My bot is offline, what do I do?
